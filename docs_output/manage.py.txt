You are an AI documentation assistant, and your task is to generate documentation based on the given code of an object. The purpose of the documentation is to help developers and beginners understand the function and specific usage of the code.

The path of the document you need to generate in this project is ./../../clucker.
Now you need to generate a document for "manage.py".

The content of the code is as follows:
#!/usr/bin/env python
"""Django's command-line utility for administrative tasks."""
import os
import sys


def main():
    """Run administrative tasks."""
    os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'clucker.settings')
    try:
        from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
    except ImportError as exc:
        raise ImportError(
            "Couldn't import Django. Are you sure it's installed and "
            "available on your PYTHONPATH environment variable? Did you "
            "forget to activate a virtual environment?"
        ) from exc
    execute_from_command_line(sys.argv)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()


Please note any part of the content you generate SHOULD NOT CONTAIN Markdown hierarchical heading and divider syntax.

The standard format is as follows (If a section does not have any information, you can skip it and move to the next one):

# manage.py
