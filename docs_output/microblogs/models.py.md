**models.py**

The `models` module in this file contains the definitions of database models used by Django applications. The most prominent model is the custom user model, `User`.

### User Model

The `User` model inherits from `AbstractUser`, a base class provided by Django for creating custom user models. This model has been modified to include additional fields: `phone`, `birthdate`. These new fields provide more information about each user.

**Username**
-----------------

The username of the user is stored using `models.CharField`. It must be unique, up to 30 characters long, and follow a specific pattern that starts with '@' followed by at least three alphanumericals. This validation is enforced by the `RegexValidator` provided in the code.

**First Name and Last Name**
-----------------------------

The user's first name and last name are stored as `models.CharField`, each up to 50 characters long. These fields do not need to be unique.

**Email**
---------

The email address of the user is stored as `models.EmailField`. It must be unique and cannot be blank.

**Bio**
--------

The bio of the user is a descriptive paragraph that can contain up to 520 characters and is optional (can be blank).

**Phone and Birthdate**
----------------------

Two new fields have been added: `phone` and `birthdate`.

*   `phone`: This field stores the phone number of the user. It is a character field, up to 15 characters long, and can be null or blank.

*   `birthdate`: This field stores the birthdate of the user. It is a date field that can be null or blank.
