    - Parameters:
        - `path_pattern` (`str`): The URL pattern.
        - `view_func` (`callable`): The view function.
        - `name` (`str`): The name of the URL route.
    - Returns:
        - `None`: No return value is specified.

**Called_functions**:

    1. Add an import:  from my_app import views
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', views.home, name='home')
