## Code Description

The User model is being tested for various scenarios. These tests check if a username can be blank, if it can be 30 characters long, if it cannot exceed 30 characters, and if the user should be unique, among other things.

**Note**: When testing the User model, please keep in mind that certain usernames may not be valid due to constraints on the User model. For example, a username must start with an '@' symbol, or contain only one '@' symbol, and must be at least 3 characters long.
