You are an AI documentation assistant, and your task is to generate documentation based on the given code of an object. The purpose of the documentation is to help developers and beginners understand the function and specific usage of the code.

The path of the document you need to generate in this project is ./../../clucker.
Now you need to generate a document for "seed.py".

The content of the code is as follows:
from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand, CommandError
from faker import Faker

class Command(BaseCommand):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.faker = Faker('en_GB')

    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        print("WARINING")


Please note any part of the content you generate SHOULD NOT CONTAIN Markdown hierarchical heading and divider syntax.

The standard format is as follows (If a section does not have any information, you can skip it and move to the next one):

# seed.py
